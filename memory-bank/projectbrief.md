# Project Brief: Cline Demo Backend

## Project Overview
This project is a Fastify backend server designed to demonstrate Cline capabilities while showcasing Clean Architecture principles. It serves as a reference implementation for building robust, maintainable backend services using modern TypeScript practices.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. User authentication system with login functionality
2. SQLite database integration for data persistence
3. RESTful API endpoints following versioning conventions
4. Swagger documentation for API endpoints
5. Proper error handling and response formatting

### Technical Requirements
1. Strict TypeScript implementation with proper typing
2. Clean Architecture with clear separation of concerns
3. SOLID principles application throughout the codebase
4. Interface-based design with dependency injection
5. Framework-agnostic business logic
6. Consistent naming conventions and file organization

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Web Framework**: Fastify
- **Database**: SQLite via better-sqlite3
- **Query Builder**: Kysely
- **Validation**: Zod
- **Logging**: Pino
- **Documentation**: Swagger UI via EJS templates

## Project Goals
1. Demonstrate best practices for backend development
2. Showcase Clean Architecture implementation in TypeScript
3. Provide a reference for proper separation of concerns
4. Illustrate effective use of interfaces and dependency injection
5. Serve as a learning resource for developers working with Cline

## Project Scope
The current scope includes a basic user authentication system with login functionality. The architecture is designed to be extensible, allowing for additional features to be added while maintaining the established patterns and principles.

## Success Criteria
1. Functional login endpoint with proper validation
2. Clean, maintainable codebase following established conventions
3. Proper error handling and response formatting
4. Comprehensive documentation of API endpoints
5. Adherence to Clean Architecture principles
