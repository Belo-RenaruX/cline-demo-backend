# Active Context: Cline Demo Backend

## Current Work Focus

The current focus of the Cline Demo Backend project is establishing a solid foundation for a Clean Architecture implementation in TypeScript. The project has successfully implemented:

1. A basic user authentication system with login functionality
2. SQLite database integration with migration support
3. Clean Architecture layers with proper separation of concerns
4. Dependency injection through interfaces and builder patterns
5. Consistent error handling and response formatting

The project serves as a demonstration of Cline's capabilities while showcasing best practices in backend development.

## Recent Changes

### Core Implementation
- Implemented login endpoint with proper validation
- Set up SQLite database with migration system
- Established Clean Architecture layers
- Created response formatting system with strategy pattern
- Implemented error handling with standardized responses

### Infrastructure
- Configured Fastify with CORS support
- Set up Zod for input/output validation
- Integrated Kysely for type-safe database queries
- Implemented Pino for logging
- Added Swagger UI for API documentation
- Replaced shell-based environment setup script with cross-platform TypeScript script
- Renamed environment setup script from `setup:env` to `setup` for simplicity


## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Implement user registration functionality
2. Add JWT authentication for protected routes
3. Create additional API endpoints for user management
4. Enhance error handling with more specific error types
5. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests

### Future Considerations
1. Implement role-based access control
2. Add caching for improved performance
3. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
4. Add health check and monitoring endpoints
5. Consider containerization for deployment

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Interface-First Design**: All public classes have corresponding interfaces to enable dependency inversion and facilitate testing.
- **Builder Pattern**: Using static factory methods to create fully-configured instances with proper dependency injection.
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracting database operations behind interfaces to decouple business logic from data access.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Using singletons for database and logger clients to prevent resource duplication.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Implementing different strategies for response formatting to ensure consistency.

### Technical Considerations
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enforcing strict type checking to catch potential issues at compile time.
- **Clean Architecture Layers**: Maintaining strict separation between layers to ensure maintainability and testability.
- **Error Handling**: Standardizing error responses to provide consistent feedback to clients.
- **Validation**: Using Zod schemas for input/output validation to ensure data integrity.
- **Database Access**: Using Kysely for type-safe database queries to prevent SQL injection and type errors.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Feature-Based Structure**: Organizing code by feature rather than by layer to improve discoverability.
- **Consistent Naming**: Following established naming conventions for files and classes.
- **Interface Segregation**: Creating focused interfaces that serve specific purposes.
- **Dependency Injection**: Injecting dependencies through constructors to improve testability.
- **Builder Pattern**: Using builder classes to create instances with proper dependencies.

### Coding Style
- **Explicit Types**: Always specifying types explicitly, even when they could be inferred.
- **Readonly Properties**: Using readonly modifiers for immutable properties.
- **Private Members**: Encapsulating implementation details with private modifiers.
- **Method Chaining**: Using method chaining for fluent interfaces where appropriate.
- **Async/Await**: Using async/await for asynchronous operations instead of callbacks or promises.

### Testing Approach
- **Mock Repositories**: Creating mock implementations of repositories for testing.
- **Interface-Based Testing**: Testing against interfaces rather than concrete implementations.
- **Isolated Unit Tests**: Testing each layer in isolation with mocked dependencies.
- **Integration Tests**: Testing the interaction between multiple layers.
- **In-Memory Database**: Using in-memory SQLite for integration tests.
