- ⬜ Health check and monitoring endpoints
- ⬜ Containerization for deployment
- ⬜ CI/CD pipeline

### Testing

- ⬜ Security tests

## Current Status

### Project Status: Foundation Established
The project has successfully established a solid foundation with a Clean Architecture implementation in TypeScript. The core login functionality is working, and the architecture is in place to support additional features.

### Development Status
- **Database**: SQLite database is set up with migration support
- **API**: Login endpoint is implemented and working
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture layers are established
- **Documentation**: API documentation is available via Swagger UI

### Deployment Status
- **Environment**: Development environment is configured
- **Database**: Local SQLite database is used for development
- **Server**: Local development server is running

## Known Issues

### Code Issues
- ⚠️ Mock repository has a typo in the password field (missing closing quote)
- ⚠️ No comprehensive test suite yet
- ⚠️ Error handling could be more specific
- ⚠️ No password hashing implemented yet

### Technical Debt
- ⚠️ Need to implement proper authentication with JWT
- ⚠️ Need to add more specific error types
- ⚠️ Need to implement proper validation for all endpoints
- ⚠️ Need to add comprehensive tests

### Future Considerations
- ⚠️ Consider adding caching for improved performance
- ⚠️ Consider implementing rate limiting for API endpoints
- ⚠️ Consider adding health check and monitoring endpoints
- ⚠️ Consider containerization for deployment

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architectural Decisions

#### Initial Decisions
- **Clean Architecture**: Decided to implement Clean Architecture for separation of concerns
- **Interface-First Design**: Decided to use interfaces for all public classes
- **Builder Pattern**: Decided to use builder pattern for dependency injection
- **Repository Pattern**: Decided to use repository pattern for data access
- **Singleton Pattern**: Decided to use singleton pattern for infrastructure clients

#### Refinements
- **Strategy Pattern**: Added strategy pattern for response formatting
- **Feature-Based Structure**: Organized code by feature rather than by layer
- **Consistent Naming**: Established naming conventions for files and classes

### Technical Decisions

#### Initial Decisions
- **TypeScript**: Decided to use TypeScript with strict mode
- **Fastify**: Decided to use Fastify as the web framework
- **SQLite**: Decided to use SQLite for the database
- **Kysely**: Decided to use Kysely for type-safe database queries
- **Zod**: Decided to use Zod for input/output validation

#### Refinements
- **Pino**: Added Pino for logging
- **CORS**: Added CORS support
- **Swagger UI**: Added Swagger UI for API documentation

### Process Decisions

#### Initial Decisions
- **Feature-First Development**: Decided to focus on one feature at a time
- **Documentation-Driven Development**: Decided to document decisions and patterns
- **Interface-Based Testing**: Decided to test against interfaces rather than implementations

#### Refinements
- **Mock Repositories**: Created mock implementations of repositories for testing
- **In-Memory Database**: Decided to use in-memory SQLite for integration tests
